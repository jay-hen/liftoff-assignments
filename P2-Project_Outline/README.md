## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    Through many years of working in the service industry throughout my teens and twenties, I have learned the unique
    struggle that many servers and baristas are faced with. Money comes in every day in the form of cash tips. Earning
    money every day and sometimes never really seeing it on paper can make it easy to lose track of earnings. I am
    creating GratTracker to assist service industry professionals in keeping tabs on their wages helping them to know
    what they earned, when they earned it, and why. Keeping a ledger of daily cash tips can guide users in financial
    decision making and in choice of work shifts.

### Features
    GratTracker will include the option to log daily the hours worked, cash tips, credit card tips, and notes about a
    particular shift. It will allow users the option to select a date and view the details about that specific day's
    shift at work. GratTracker will aggregate data about money earned to display relevant facts about the user's
    earnings such as average tips based on hours worked and which shifts are the most profitable. All of this info will
    be saved based on user authentification.

### Technologies
   Java
   HTML
   Spring Boot
   Thymeleaf
   MVC Design Pattern

### What I'll Have to Learn
    Considering learning a new front end framework for making it look nice and considering learning Spring Security for
    authentification. I will have to learn how to display graphs.
